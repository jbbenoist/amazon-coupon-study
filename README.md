This repository contains my submission project of module 5-1 from Professional Certificate in Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence by Berkeley ExecEd/Berkeley Haas

## The context

During the exercise, I have worked on analyzing data from a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk that describes different driving scenarios when the drivers receives a coupon and the objective was to determine if the drivers would use the coupons or not depending on their scenarios.

## The results

First the general rate of acceptance was approximatively 57%.

Then I have focused my study on the coupons for Bars where the rate of acceptance was approximatively 41%.
It was below the general rate of acceptance but after some researches it has been possible to show that we could reach very good acceptance rates working with samples of the population, for example: the people who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 have an acceptance rate of the coupons of 69%.

Finally I have focused on the coupons the more distributed in this survey the once for the Coffee Houses with an approximate rate of acceptance of 50%. I found that if we find at least two of these characteristics: receive a coupon valid for one day, receive the coupon at 10am and send the coupon to people going 1 to 3 times to the Coffee House, I found out that we could reach a rate of acceptance of approximatively 72%.

If you want more details on how I found these results or see the size of the samples used, you can find all the details in my notebook referred in the section below.
